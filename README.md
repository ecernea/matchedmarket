*I would like to acknowledge and thank Louisa Conway and Granceann Blank. Louisa originally wrote the matched market code, and I have simply provided edits for clarity and ease of use. Graceann has helped me write, edit, and understand the purpose of the matched market test. Her guidance is invalubable.*
